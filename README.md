# JNP1
Solutions of graded problems from course about C++ conducted at MIMUW in the academic year 2019/20. Each of the problems focuses on some core concepts from c++ 17. In more details:

* [Problem1](https://github.com/Podkamienna/JNP1/tree/main/Problem1) focused on C++ basics:
	* strings
	* STL containers
	* iterators.
* [Problem2](https://github.com/Podkamienna/JNP1/tree/main/Problem2) focused on more advanced C++ basiscs: 
	* linking C and C++ code together
	* name mangeling
	* header guards
	* namespaces
	* global object initialization (eg. static initialization fiasco)
* [Problem3](https://github.com/Podkamienna/JNP1/tree/main/Problem3) focused on:
	* enums
	* typedefs
	* references
	* classes
	* constructors
	* temporary objects
* [Problem4](https://github.com/Podkamienna/JNP1/tree/main/Problem4) focused on templates and metaprogramming:
	* typename keyword
	* template specialization and overloading
	* constexpr
	* variadic templates
* [Problem6](https://github.com/Podkamienna/JNP1/tree/main/Problem6) focused on OOP:
	* more advanced class-connected construction
	* design patterns
* [Problem7](https://github.com/Podkamienna/JNP1/tree/main/Problem7) focused on functional programming in C++:
	* lambda functions
	* function pointers
