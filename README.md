# JNP1
Solutions of graded problems from course about C++ conducted at MIMUW in the academic year 2019/20. Each of the problems focuses on some core concepts from c++ 17. In more details:

* [Problem1]() focused on C++ basics:
	* strings
	* STL containers
	* iterators.
* [Problem2]() focused on more advanced C++ basiscs: 
	* linking C and C++ code together
	* name mangeling
	* header guards
	* namespaces
	* global object initialization (eg. static initialization fiasco)
* [Problem3]() focused on:
	* enums
	* typedefs
	* references
	* classes
	* constructors
	* temporary objects
* [Problem4]() focused on templates and metaprogramming:
	* typename keyword
	* template specialization and overloading
	* constexpr
	* variadic templates
* [Problem5]() focused on RAII, memory management and exceptions:
	* pointers vs iterators
	* handling exceptions
	* move semantics
	* smart pointers
* [Problem6]() focused on functional programming in C++:
	* lambda functions
	* function pointers
